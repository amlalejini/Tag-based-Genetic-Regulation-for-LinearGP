## Exploratory experiments

We carried out a series of exploratory experiments for proof of concept and parameter tuning.

- [Mutation rate tuning](./exploratory/mut-rate-exps/)
- [2020-06-04 - bool-calc](./exploratory/2020-06-04-bool-calc/)
  - Early version of boolean calculator problem.
  - Uses postfix notation and requires programs to identify invalid input sequences.
- [2020-08-04 - sig-reprog](./exploratory/2020-08-04-sig-reprog/)
  - Early version of the contextual-signal problem
- [2020-08-05 - bc-prefix](./exploratory/2020-08-05-bc-prefix/)
  - First exploration of prefix notation with boolean-logic calculator problem.
- [2020-11-10 - rep-sig](./exploratory/2020-11-10-rep-sig/)
  - Identical to 2020-11-25 experiment, except did not include instruction execution traces.
- [2020-11-12 - context-sig](./exploratory/2020-11-12-context-sig/)
  - Identical to 2020-11-27 experiment, except did not include instruction execution traces.
- [2020-11-13 - bool-calc-postfix](./exploratory/2020-11-13-bool-calc-postfix/)
  - Identical to 2020-11-28 postfix experiment, except did not include instruction execution traces.
- [2020-11-13 - bool-calc-prefix](./exploratory/2020-11-13-bool-calc-prefix/)
  - Identical to 2020-11-28 prefix experiment, except did nt include instruction execution traces.
